# Fast Food and Twitter
## Mapping Consumer Sentiment to Better Understand and Target Customers

NOTE: This README is a work in progress 

The intersection of fast food consumers and Twitter users is surprisingly wide. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the vast majority of fast food consumers are middle class- in fact, even the most affluent are only [marginally less likely](https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/12/health/poor-americans-fast-food-partner/index.html) (80% vs. 73%) than the poorest to eat fast food on a regular basis. Fast food consumption also trends young, peaking in the 18-29 age group. Likewise, *Twitter* trends young and affluent. Of its ~69 million regular users in the United States, [36% are in the 18-29 age group](https://blog.hootsuite.com/twitter-statistics/)(its largest demographic) and these users are more likely than not to have some college education. Equally, if not more important, 74% of Twitter users get at least some of their news on Twitter (more than the 68% of *Facebook* users) and a similar number follow brands for product updates and promotions. 

With numbers like these, building and maintaining a strong brand presence on Twitter is vital to stay competitve. In that light, I collected 170,000 customer (and ~10,000 company) tweets over three weeks (March 9-30) to evaluate brand favorability and consumer behavior for 11 fast food chains (targeting tweets that used the company's handle, ex.'I love @McDonalds!'). With scripts collecting data four times per day on an Amazon Web Service EC2, I sought to use customer profiles and behavior to predict favorability toward a brand, hierarchically clustered consumers by company, identified the best times and days for marketing, and looked at the relationship between brand favorability and stock price over time (targeting the following publicly traded companies for that reason: *McDonald's, Chipotle, Starbucks, Denny's, Wendy's, Dunkin Donuts, Domino's, Sonic, Shake Shack, Wingstop, Cracker Barrel*). 

## #The Data

This project presented a number of challenges. First, Twitter's API limits the number of tweets you can capture per day (without paying), preventing comprehensive collection and making the analysis reliant on Twitter's algorithm for randomizing sample tweets. Second, I only collected data for three weeks and at fixed hours, introducing likely time and seasonal bias in the data collection. Third, there is no way to ensure that tweets are from genuine customers/consumers and not purchased endorsements or automated accounts ([some estimates suggest 15% of Twitter 'users' are actually bots](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/10/nearly-48-million-twitter-accounts-could-be-bots-says-study.html)). Fourth, using natural langauge processing to assess consumer preference is an error prone process (I tested prebuilt NLTK & textblob sentiment analyzers); I manually assessed a randomized subset of tweets and identified a misclassication rate of ~20% across three dummy categories (positive, negative, neutral). 

Facing these challenges, I tested various solutions (detailed throughout this README) and do my best to be fully transparent where results might be biased. For example, of the 170,000+ tweets collected, I had to eliminate nearly 80,000 due to missing or incomplete data. Likewise, I  dropped two companies from the dataset (*Potbelly & Red Robin*) because of insufficient observations. Still, the datasets were rich for exploration. Before any feature creation/transformation, the scraped customer dataset  included 14 features and the scraped company dataset included 11 features (including: tweet & profile text, time, retweets, favorites, user verification, followers, total tweets, etc.). 

## #Brand Positivity

I measured brand positivity using the mean [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/quickstart.html#sentiment-analysis) sentiment score (also referred to here as *polarity*)- a floating number between -1 (totally negative) & 1 (totally positive) per tweet.  TextBlob's polarity score is robust to negation (ex. 'not great', is scored -1, 'great' 1 ), can interpret emoticon sentiment (ex. ðŸ˜€ 1 and ðŸ˜’ -1), and is built off of the academic work of the [respected *pattern* library](https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/pages/pattern-web). Overall, polarity skewed positive- 44% of tweets were positive, 15% were negative, and 43% were neutral.

The graphic below shows brand positivity, company by company, as a measure of the polarity of customer mentions:

</p>

In addition to showing substantial variation in brand performance (all, on average, more positive than negative), the results are reassuring of the validity of the metric based on prior knowledge of brand popularity. The top performer, Shake Shack, is renowned for its carefully crafted branding and the (generally positive) hype surrounding [its burgers](https://www.investors.com/research/the-new-america/how-shake-shacks-growth-may-catch-up-to-its-hype/). In contrast, the worst performer, Domino's, has had its brand repeatedly battered by scandal and, despite what the [*Harvard Business Review* suggests](https://hbr.org/2016/11/how-dominos-pizza-reinvented-itself), has not completely rebounded. 

However, including a measure of only unique tweets (the orange bars below)- eliminating retweets and multiple tweets by the same user- shows a clear decline in overall sentiment and a reordering of the companies' comparative scores. 

<p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/slevin886/twitter_fast_food_analysis/blob/master/images/polarity.png" height="420" width="560">
</p>

Starbucks and Shake Shack both see 6% declines in overall favorability, while Wendy's favorability increases by 2%. The mechanism for the decrease is not only through fewer positive tweets, but also a proportional increase in negative tweets. That the change in score varies widely across companies can lend itself to various interpretations. It could be purely random variation (although the likelihood from a two-sided t-test that the group's share a mean is only ~2.6%). Some companies could be paying for trend-setters to create more 'retweetable' content (NOTE: these are NOT retweets of the company's tweets- I purposely did not include those in this analysis) or it could indicate that some companies are purchasing retweets- [a common strategy](http://www.businessinsider.com/fake-twitter-followers-test-2012-8). 

## #New Customer Acquisition & Company Clustering

In a mature and competitive market like fast food in the US, capturing a competitor's customers is key to growing market share. However, it is important to know *which* company's customers you should target. I analyzed the profiles of each company's customers (transforming text profiles (grouped by company) into a numeric TF-IDF matrix) to identify company clusters based on the similarities (as a function of word frequency by company and the inverse of dispersion across companies) of their customers' profiles. 

The heatmap below shows the cosine similarities (**larger numbers/lighter colors** indicate **more** similarity between company customers. *Cosine similarity* is a measure of the directional similarity of vectors).

<p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/slevin886/twitter_fast_food_analysis/blob/master/images/heatmap.png" height="420" width="560">
</p>

By this metric, Chipotle and Wendy's have the most similar customers while Wingstop and Starbucks customers are the most dissimilar. Overall, McDonald's has the most in common with the other companies (narrowly edging out Dunkin Donuts) and Wingstop has the least in common with other companies (by a wide margin- and it is not a function of company size, Wingstop marketcap is bigger than Denny's & Sonic). 

Another method I used to assess customer similarity was hierarchical clustering (a method that iterates through data points and identifies the 'nearest' similar data points- I locally optimized with 'Ward's method' which seeks to minimize variance between clusters, still using the TF-IDF vectors). The graphic below, called a *dendrogram*, shows the clustering of companies (the *lower* on the chart two companies are connected, the more similar their customers are).

<p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/slevin886/twitter_fast_food_analysis/blob/master/images/dendrogram.png" height="420" width="560">
</p>

Just as with cosine similarities, Chipotle and Wendy's customers share the most profile information in common, trailed closely by the pairings of Dunkin Donuts & Sonic and Domino's & McDonald's. Again, Wingstop customers are markedly different from all other company groupings. 

The graphic below shows customer Twitter activity (the *median* customer's number of followers and number of tweets). Additionally, I chose to vary the colors by the percentage of company customers that are verified (i.e. a public figure- 2% of all unique customers in the dataset (0.06% of active twitter users generally)) from **red** (more verified customers) to **black** (fewer verified customers). 

<p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/slevin886/twitter_fast_food_analysis/blob/master/images/consumer_popularity.png" height="420" width="560">
</p>

Shake Shack customers are the most popular (most followers) and second most active (behind Wingstop). 4% of them are also verified (the most in the group as a percentage, and second behind Dunkin Donuts in absolute number). Interestingly, however, this is not driving their brand favorability. Non-verified Shake Shack customers are 20% *more* positive about the company than their verified customers (of course, verified users are more likely paid influencers or partners than actual customers). In the same vein, verified customers are only 7% more positive than non-verified across all companies. 

However, Domino's and McDonalds are exceptions. Verified customers are 52% more positive (than non-verified customers) about Domino's and 38% more positve McDonald's. This is likely an indication of the emphasis these companies are placing on purchasing positive endorsements. 

## #Building Popularity & Positivity

Another measure of brand favorability is the 'favorite count' (the equivalent of 'liking' a post on *Facebook*). In the sample, favorite count is heavily skewed (84% of tweets have 0 favorites, while the top tweet has 857). Below you can see the mean sentiment score contrasted with the mean favorite count. 

<p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/slevin886/twitter_fast_food_analysis/blob/master/images/company_pops.png" height="420" width="560">
</p>

As you can see above, there is no obvious visual (or quantitative for that matter) correlation between mean favorite count and mean sentiment. This runs against the idea of [hypercriticism](http://bigthink.com/ideafeed/is-negative-content-more-likely-to-go-viral) (the idea that negative statements tend to be more intelligent, and by extension, more popular) and instead suggests that at least in this sample neither positivity nor negativity drive the popularity of a tweet. Therefore, it may be no fool's errand to encourage positive customer tweeting (ex. through clever hashtags) in the hopes of virality. 

This is in marked contrast to the favorite count of a company's own tweets, which have a strong positive correlation with their overall brand favorability  (0.31 pearson correlation). This is not a contradiction. It makes intuitive sense that having more customers willing to favorite company tweets (inevitably positive or neutral in sentiment) would indicate more customers willing to tweet their own positive reaction to the brand. 

Positivity is not equally distributed across customers. I looked at the percentage of unique words and percentage of correctly spelled words per customer profile to see how public presentation affected tweet sentiment. 

<p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/slevin886/twitter_fast_food_analysis/blob/master/images/sentiment_vocab.png" height="460" width="700">
</p>

In both cases, there are strong positive correlations with sentiment (0.31 for unique, 0.30 for correctly spelled). The more conscientious the profile creator, measured as a more diverse and accurately spelled vocabulary, the more likely to tweet positively. All things equal, this may be a factor to consider when targeting new customers. 

## #Marketing by Day & Time

Over the three weeks of data collected, Tuesday narrowly edged out Thursday for the highest overall volume of tweets (with nearly 3x Sunday's tweet volume- the slowest day). Tuesday also had the highest overall positive sentiment, while Thursday sits in 4th behind Monday and Wednesday. Undoubtedly, running ads when Twitter is heavily trafficked with positive consumers is an advantageous strategy for customer retention marketing. 

Below, you can see the sentiment of customer tweets by company across each day of the week (the width of the line being a measure of the mean favorite count by day):

<p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/slevin886/twitter_fast_food_analysis/blob/master/images/weekdaysentiment.png" height="420" width="560">
</p>

The peak in Tweet positivity on Tuesday is unmistakable, although there is substantial cross-company variation (Cracker Barrel peaks Thursday, Domino's Wednesday). Likewise, Saturday and Sunday clearly trail the weekdays in positive sentiment. This is not to say these days shouldn't be a focus of online engagement. Targeting dissatisfied customers with direct messages or targeting other companies' dissatisfied customers through a campaign could both be winning strategies.    

The graphic below shows the average daily tweet volume by company. In contrast to the large differences in daily sentiment across companies, there is high covariance in tweet volume. However, it can't be ruled out that this isn't at least somewhat biased by the artificial limits Twitter put on the number of Tweets I could scrape. 

<p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/slevin886/twitter_fast_food_analysis/blob/master/images/mentions_by_day.png" height="365" width="630">
</p>

Identifying the optimal time of day to target customers was trickier. At any given collection time, Twitter returns a 'randomized' subset for a given query- not necessarily uniformly distributed across time. Likewise, I automated the script to collect customer tweets at 5pm and 12am EST daily (9am & 2pm EST for company tweets), scattering the times to account for scrape limits. To solve this problem, I looked at the negativity *rate* (i.e. the number of negative tweets as a percentage of all tweets at a given hour). 

<p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/slevin886/twitter_fast_food_analysis/blob/master/images/negrate2.png" height="460" width="1000">
</p>

From the graphic above, 4pm and 9am jump out as times with high tweet volume and low negativity rate- ideal for targeting large numbers of satisfied customers. On the other hand, and perhaps unsurprisingly, negativity tends to peak overnight with fewer customers tweeting.

## #Company Behavior and Effectiveness

The graphic below shows the companies ordered by their market capitalization alongside each company's total number of Twitter followers and total number of tweets. Alongside each figure is a visual representation of brand favorability (the **larger** and **redder** the square, the *more popular* the brand).

<p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/slevin886/twitter_fast_food_analysis/blob/master/images/comp_behav.png" height="320" width="560">
</p>

Brand favorability on Twitter is not being driven by the market's valuation of the company or its total followers/tweets (in fact the latter have small negative correlaitons with favorability, while market cap has only a small positive correlation). However, as you can see in the next graphic, tweets per follower *does* have a strong positive correlation with overall brand sentiment.

<p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/slevin886/twitter_fast_food_analysis/blob/master/images/per_user_sent.png" height="500" width="640">
</p>

Looking at a basic 2-degree polynomial OLS model, we are able to capture ~50% of company variation in sentiment looking only at tweets per user. This should give a strong indication that actively tweeting *directly* to your customers (and reaching a higher percentage of them) will pay dividends in reputation. Companies, to varying degrees, seem to already understand this. Of the ~10,000 company tweets I collected, 90.8% were direct customer outreach (i.e. they started with "@CustomerName"). 

Given that the vast majority of tweets in the sample were direct customer outreach, rather than general marketing tweets, an analysis of company hashtag use may be unreliable (i.e. it is not obvious that I captured all of each company's primary hashtags or a fair representation of their use). However, in so far as companies use their hashtags regularly in direct customer outreach, the graphic below shows company hashtag use and effectiveness in eliciting reuse:

<p align="left">
  <img src="https://github.com/slevin886/twitter_fast_food_analysis/blob/master/images/hash_use.png" height="225" width="640">
</p>

Again, before any interpretation, it is worth reiterating that this sample is small and likely biased (companies may differ in when they use hashtags (i.e. for/not for direct customer outreach) , but not in overall use). Having said that, there is a strong positive correlation between the volume of company hashtage use and customer reuse (even after controlling for Cracker Barrel). Likewise, there is a strong positive correlation between customer hashtag reuse and tweet sentiment. It stands to reason that using more hashtags, specifically more *unique* hashtags (variation in hashtag use showing a stronger positive correlation with sentiment), can help drive brand favorability.
